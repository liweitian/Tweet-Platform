Nice work.

- Make sure to append `id` to the `Follower` columns, i.e., `follower_id` and `followed_id`, both of which should represent `id`s of users in the database.

- Also, make sure to use upper case for your model names. e.g., `Privatespace` should be `PrivateSpace`.
Everywhere else, use underscores: `private_space`
