Final Grade

Score: (27/30)

Notes: 

1. I was unable to sign up for a new account with the account name `rachel` and password `rachel`. However, no validation
errors appeared on the form, so as a user, I was unable to determine what was causing the error.

2. About Us/Help/Contact Us links at the top of the root page did not appear to go anywhere. It's totally clear what 
the purpose of the root page is -- it seems unrelated to the rest of your app.

3. The chart does not appear to be working -- regardless of my search query, the chart showed `100%`. My search 
also did not appear on the page at all.

Nice work.

- Make sure to append `id` to the `Follower` columns, i.e., `follower_id` and `followed_id`, both of which should represent `id`s of users in the database.

- Also, make sure to use upper case for your model names. e.g., `Privatespace` should be `PrivateSpace`.
Everywhere else, use underscores: `private_space`
